# ff2_boss_viewer
A SourceMod plugin designed to neatly list all available Freak Fortress 2 bosses and some of their config data(Descriptions, health, themes...)
in a browser.

***WIP, more features and QoL things will be added shortly***

**Requirements:**
- Webcon & Conplex by asherkin
- Freak Fortress 2

**Installation:**
- Compile and install to respective directories. 
- Load the plugin or change map.

**Providing boss images:**
Create .png images of your bosses and upload them to /configs/web/bosses/images.
Take placeholder.png dimensions as an example to avoid having different image sizes.

**Live example:**
http://95.172.92.47:27015/bosses/

**Credits**
- Naydef for general assistance
- NecGaming for being my personal sandbox, as usual
- MadeInQuick for providing the placeholder image
- Respective authors of code pieces that I borrowed (50-DKP team of Official Freak Fortress, ...)
